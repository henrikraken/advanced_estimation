      subroutine set_h_y_i( h_row, y, n, i_obs, seed, epsilon )

* Purpose: Set the row of h and the value of y
*          for obs number i_obs.
*
* Returns the row of h in the vector h_row.

* Another concern is writing your programs so they can be carried from one compiler to the next without the need for
* reprogramming compiler dependent statements.  In choosing kind numbers there are ways to make your codes "portable"
* (meaning they can be executed on any Fortran 90 compiler without compiler dependent errors).  You can do this by
* declaring a kind number for single and double-precision in the declaration section of your program.
* 
*     INTEGER, PARAMETER  ::  double = SELECTED_REAL_KIND (12)
* 
*     REAL (KIND = double) :: A, B
* 
* In this series of commands the parameter double has been assigned the kind value for double-precision,
* since SELECTED_REAL_KIND (12) means select the kind value to give 12 digits of accuracy, which will
* require double precision.  The kind for A and B has been assigned the number for double-precision.  Code written with
* such declarations are portable without corrections. 

      integer, parameter  ::  single = selected_real_kind (6)
      integer, parameter  ::  double = selected_real_kind (12)

*     seed needs to be dimension 2 for F90.
      integer, parameter  ::  seed_dim = 2



      integer n, i_obs
      real (kind = double) :: h_row( n ), y
      real (kind = single) :: random_j
      integer seed(seed_dim)
      real (kind = double) :: epsilon

      integer i, j, k



*     print *, 'single, double, seed_dim print= ', 
*    >          single, double, seed_dim



*.....If this is first obs:
*     Initialize random number generator.  
*     Check dimension of seed.
*     Set seed.

*.....Set row H with random numbers between -10 and 10.
*     Random number generator returns random numbers between 0 and 1.
