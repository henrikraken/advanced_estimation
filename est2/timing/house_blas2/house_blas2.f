      subroutine house_blas2( h_y, ldh, m, n, u, scr)

* Purpose: Zero out elements in h_y below the diagonal in the
*          first n columns using Householder transformations.
*          h_y contains the m by n H matrix, plus y in the last column,
*          so the dimensions of h_y are m by (n+1).

* Another concern is writing your programs so they can be carried from one compiler to the next without the need for
* reprogramming compiler dependent statements.  In choosing kind numbers there are ways to make your codes "portable"
* (meaning they can be executed on any Fortran 90 compiler without compiler dependent errors).  You can do this by
* declaring a kind number for single and double-precision in the declaration section of your program.
* 
*     INTEGER, PARAMETER  ::  double = SELECTED_REAL_KIND (12)
* 
*     REAL (KIND = double) :: A, B
* 
* In this series of commands the parameter double has been assigned the kind value for double-precision (p = 12 will
* require double precision).  The kind for A and B has been assigned the number for double-precision.  Code written with
* such declarations are portable without corrections.

      subroutine house_2( B, ldB, rows_B, cols_B, u, beta, gamma )

* Purpose: Multiply a matrix by a Householder.

      integer, parameter  ::  double = selected_real_kind (12)

      integer ldB, rows_B, cols_B
      real (kind = double) :: B( ldB, cols_B), u( rows_B )
      real (kind = double) :: beta, gamma(cols_B)

*     Calculate T * B,

*     where u' = u transpose
*
*     T * B = ( I - beta * u * u' ) * B 
*           = B - beta * u * u' * B 
*           = B - u * gamma

*     First, calculate gamma = beta * u' * B.
*     This is a matrix vector multiply.
*
*     NOTE: gemv has no capability to calculate beta * u' * B.
*     Instead, it can calcluate beta * B' * u.  Both beta * u' * B and
*     beta * B' * u are vectors.  Technically, beta * u' * B is a row
*     vector, while beta * B' * u is a column vector.  But in Fortran,
*     they are both just vectors.  You yourself have to keep track of
*     whether a Fortran vector represents a row vector or a column
*     vector.  So calculating beta * B' * u
*     and putting it into the gamma vector would give the same
*     Fortran gamma vector as calculating beta * B' * u and putting it
*     into the gamma vector.  So we use gemv to calculate beta * B' * u
*     and put it into the gamma vector, and we remember that represents
*     a row vector.  More on this in the dger step below.

      call dgemv('Transpose', rows_B, cols_B, beta, B, ldB, u, 1,
     >            0, gamma,1 )

*.....Now calculate
*
*     T * B = B - beta * u * u' * B = B - u * gamma
*
*     and overwrite B with this result.
*     This is a rank-1 update to B.
*
*     NOTE:  See note above at the gemv step.
*     gamma represents a row vector.  But Fortran has no way to specify
*     that.  So it is just a vector.  We want to calculate
*     B - u * gamma, where u is a column vector and gamma is a row
*     vector.  But there is no way to tell BLAS that gamma is a row
*     vector.  It thinks it is just a vector.  So in Fortran, we have
*     to treat gamma like it is a column vector, and ask dger to
*     calcluate B - u * gamma'.

      call dger( rows_B, cols_B, -1.d0, u, 1, gamma, 1, B, ldB )
